# Employment Verification Letter Usecase

## Summary
An employment verification letter is a document provided by an employer that confirms an employee's job status, including details such as their job title, employment dates, and sometimes salary. It's commonly used for various purposes, such as applying for loans, renting an apartment, or verifying employment for background checks. The letter typically includes the employer's contact information, the employee's name, and a brief description of their role and employment period. This helps third parties verify the employee's current or past employment and income.

Value Statement: Automating employment verification letters streamlines HR processes, ensuring accurate and timely documentation with minimal manual effort. This efficiency boost enhances response times and reduces errors, benefiting both employees and third-party requestors.

IBM has successfuly implemented this usecase in IBM AskHR and customer POC's leveraging Workday HCM.
