# Transfer an Employee Usecase

## Summary

The HR use case for transferring an employee involves moving an employee from one position, department, or location to another within the organization. This process includes updating job titles, responsibilities, and reporting structures, as well as managing any necessary adjustments to compensation, benefits, and training.

Value Statement: Automating employee transfers enhances efficiency by streamlining the updating of job roles, compensation, and reporting structures. This ensures a smooth transition with minimal manual intervention, reducing errors and improving employee experience and operational continuity.

IBM has successfuly implemented this usecase in IBM AskHR. The current customer POC's are in progress.

## Prerequisites

### IBM Technologies

1. IBM watsonx Orchestrate

### Supporting Technologies

1. Oracle HCM with access to "workers" API and ability to perform a PATCH function

## Quickstart

1. Upload the Oracle HCM API Spec under assets

2. Create a skill flow leveraging the API Spec as such:
  
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "watsonx Orchestrate Skill Flow"
    A(Get Worker)--> B(Get Worker Assignments)-->C(Patch Worker Assignment)
    end
```
3. Set the input parameters for each:
    1. Use the `workerId` output from "Get Worker" for input on "Get Worker Assignment"
    2. Use the `workerId` output from "Get Worker Assignments" for input on "Patch Worker Assignment"

:::note
Confirm with the customer if there are multiple assignments per worker. This documentation assumes 1 assignment per worker and will use/change the first assignment entry from `Get Worker Assignment`
:::

## Assets

1. Supporting Oracle HCM API (Skills)

:::warning
1. The below YAML is used to integrate with the IBM-owned Oracle HCM instance for use with pre-sales POC's
2. Source the `server` URL from IBM Internal documentation - denoted by "#######"
:::

:::danger
1. Path "publicWorker" API must be replaced with "worker" API. Currently, worker API is not exposed by IBM-owned Oracle HCM instance. The fix is in progress
2. API spec is not currently formatted to pass the watsonx Orchestrate validation requirements
