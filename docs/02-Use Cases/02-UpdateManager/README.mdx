# Update Employee Manager Usecase

## Summary

The HR use case for transferring an employee involves moving an employee from one manager to another within the organization.

Value Statement: Automating employee manager transfers enhances efficiency by streamlining the need to update reporting structures. This ensures a smooth transition with minimal manual intervention in the backend technology, reducing errors and improving employee experience and operational continuity.

IBM has successfuly implemented this usecase in IBM AskHR and in customer facing POCs.
